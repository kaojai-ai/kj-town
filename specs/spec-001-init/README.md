i want to build a quick fancy interactive 3d environment that can be played on web.
Try utilize Three.js library, WebGL Technology.

I want to show different services, and tools in my current platform system architecture.
But show them in a city like environment, with building, factory, landscape, etc.

I already generated the reference image what it should look like, as a 2d, in file `kj-town.png`

I want to turn them into 3d looks, can zoom, can pan the angle, using normal web browser.

Let use WebGL, Three.js lib to implement this
Please try to make it fancy, detail like in reference image as much as possible.
