## Status

🚧 Concept phase (WIP)

Right now it’s **not fully automated yet** — we’re still shaping the pipeline that turns repo/architecture signals into a living 3D town.

That said, with current tech, we believe this is **very deliverable soon**.

Contributions welcome. If you think it’s cool let us know by starring this GitHub repo ⭐️🙌

## How does it work?

There will be a service that watches changes in your git repository organization. It checks for new services, how they are related, and your infrastructure (database, cache layer, etc.) and turns them into a city or town automatically.

Basically, the more you work, the more developed this virtual town becomes!
