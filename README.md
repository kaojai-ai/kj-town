## Concept

KJ Town is a tool that automatically builds a 3D town based on your system architecture using WebGL technology.

## Status

The project is currently ongoing. 🚧

## License

MIT

## How does it work?

There will be a service that watches changes in your git repository organization. It checks for new services, how they are related, and your infrastructure (database, cache layer, etc.) and turns them into a city or town automatically.

Basically, the more you work, the more developed this virtual town becomes!
