i want to build a quick fancy interactive minecraft-like

that show different services, and tools in my current platform system architecture.

But show them in a city like environment, with building, factory, landscape, etc.

I just want only 3d looks, can zoom, can pan the angle, but  not able to make any interaction to make the task simple

i want it to be able to render online, like through normal website

Let use WebGL in the browser to implement this

The system architecture blueprint is in blueprint.puml

Try to turn those entity into a building, factory, publci display etc.
that look like a real city.
